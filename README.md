In this project, we will explore setting up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline using Github, Sonarqube, and Docker on an AWS EC2 instance.

Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that helps automate various tasks in the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying software. GitHub is a code repository that provides version control and collaboration tools, and Sonarqube is a code quality management tool that helps analyze and manage code quality in software projects. Docker is a containerization platform that helps simplify the deployment of software applications.

First, we will create an AWS EC2 instance and install Jenkins. We will then set up a Github repository and integrate it with Jenkins. Next, we will configure Sonarqube to analyze code quality in our GitHub repository. Finally, we will create a Docker image of our application [https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page292/chain-app-dev] and deploy it using Jenkins.

Throughout the project, we will explain the importance of each step and provide detailed instructions on how to configure each tool to work together seamlessly. By the end of this practice, you will have a working CI/CD pipeline that will help automate the software development process and ensure the quality of your code.

Whether you are a developer, software engineer, or DevOps professional, these tutorials will provide valuable insights on setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Github, Sonarqube, and Docker on an AWS EC2 instance.
